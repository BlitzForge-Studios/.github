# Welcome to BlitzForge Studios! 👐🏻

Hey! We’re BlitzForge Studios, and we’re bringing *Dungeon Blitz* back to life — right in your browser. No waiting around, no red tape. We’re rebuilding the whole thing from scratch, using **pure C++**, no engines, just solid code and stubborn passion.

- **What we’re doing now:** Making the original game playable 
- **What’s next:** A full remake, built from the ground up in C++

## Who’s behind all this?

- **İbrahim** – Leads the project and keeps everything on track  
- **Tommy** – Our lead dev, the guy making the magic actually happen

We’re pumped to get this back into players’ hands. Stick around — we’ll have more to share soon.
